# Thingy Track - A tracking dashboard for the Nordic Thingy:91

This PHP and JavaScript portal displays the exact GSP location, or predicted location using the cellular network (with error shown), of a Nordic Thingy:91.

The portal is a fully automatic Smart City display application and intended for public display of device locations.

This code is part of an Elecromaker contest. A link to the entry and further details will be added here soon.

To deploy simply copy the files in htdocs to your web server (online hosting or a local Raspberry Pi are equally good). Add your API Key and Device ID to location.php (details on how to do this will be added to the Elecromaker project page soon).
