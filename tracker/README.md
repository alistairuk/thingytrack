The custom tracker is still under development and sadly will not be ready for the Electromaker contest deadline, but the rest of the project is fully compatible with any firmware that updates Nordic's nFR Cloud with a location. The [nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2/README.html#asset-tracker-v2) will work equally well, although it will use a little more data and consume a little more power. This can be downloaded with the base firmware from [the Nordic web site](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/ug_thingy91_gsg.html#updating-firmware-through-usb).
